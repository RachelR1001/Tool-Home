2. What is it

    The project is a vending machine system called “Tool Home” that aims to facilitate the self-service borrowing and returning of tools for students, while also making tool management more convenient for administrators. It is primarily composed of five parts: 1. RFID lock system, 2. Shelf & motor, 3. Camera for testing, 4. Weight sensor for testing, 5. Infrared sensor light and waving hand.

     One of the unique features of our design is the space-saving shelf design. We use three circular shelves, each with three columns of storage space, which can rotate independently. This allows us to accommodate as many items as possible.
